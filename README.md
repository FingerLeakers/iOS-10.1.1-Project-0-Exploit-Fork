# iOS-10.1.1-Project-0-Exploit-For-Jailbreak---F.C.E.-365-Fork-
This is the Google's Project 0 exploits for iOS 10.1.1 modified a little bit. This project contains support for all x64 devices and I redesigned the white app page to tell the user he should be focusing on the Xcode Debug terminal not on the phone. Also there is a notification that the fork is not the original project.
